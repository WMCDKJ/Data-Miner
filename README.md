# Data-Miner
Reading data in files using python in a simple GUI

A program that reads data from multiple files in the "data" folder to program memory. 
Once the data is loaded from the folder to the program, it reads files with "mydat" extension only and skips the other files. 
If the mydat file contains data in a different format when reading data, the program identifies it as a faulty file.
Finally, the program prints the total number of data rows read.

***guilib developed by university of Oulu has been used to design the Graphical Use Interfaces.
